# User Stories ‚Äì Smart Clinic Management System

This document outlines the core user stories for the Smart Clinic Management System. These stories are written from the perspective of three main user roles: **Admin**, **Doctor**, and **Patient**. Each story captures the user‚Äôs goal and the reason behind it, forming the basis for feature development in future sprints.
